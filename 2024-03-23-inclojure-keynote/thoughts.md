# Thoughts: IN/Clojure 2024 Keynote

A personal story: about something I felt like I'd lost and I now feel like I'm finding again.

Apology: This isn't exactly a Clojure talk.
We'll talk about some languages which have a lot in common with Clojure today:

* C# -- clean features, Decimal suffixed with 'M'
* Ruby
* Rust
* Common Lisp
* Visual Basic 3.0
* SQL
* Perl (Raku)

## Titles?

"The Grift, the Grind, and the ग्रंथ"

## Story Arc

* childhood: computers were Only For Fun
    * mystery: gopher, BBSes, Archie, Veronica
* demoscene (show farbrauche?)
    * sharing, but also showing off
* making video games (Insomnia)
    * puzzle-solving ... and reading Win32 API documentation
* B.Sc. - learning the rules, step 1
    * RubyConf 2005, Denver
    * Linux, f/oss, sharing -- Hacker Ethos (felt but not read)
* ThoughtWorks - learning the rules, step 2
    * Ruby @ Work
    * TDD, CI, IoC (which for some people meant dependency injection)
    * Dynamic/Static religious wars... pick a side
    * XTech Paris: 3 tracks (one honeypot), cool/fun talks just because
* Clojure - learning the rules, step 3 (tiny libs, frameworks = bad, metaprogramming = bad)
    * "Choose Your QBASIC" => "Are We There Yet?" == sold.
    * picked a religion
    * already in love with LISP, Clojure validated a bookcase full of "On Lisp", "Lisp In Small Pieces", "Practical Common Lisp",
      "Little/Reasoned/Seasoned Schemer", "Immutable Data Structures"
    * ClojureConj 1.0 -- JOY -- "I didn't title the book 'The Joy of Connecting to a MySQL database.'"
        * Christophe Grand's talk
    * Chris Houser on the Expression Problem: "I think this is pronounced 'a sock'."
* Nilenso
    * helped start
    * pushed Clojure (my religion)
    * set a certain bar
* Pandemic
    * Hackers, Hacker Ethos
    * XTDB, written in Clojure
    * Endb, written in Rust + SBCL

## The Grift

* everyone is out to sell something
* thanks to social media and "influencers", this is somehow okay now
    * "Building in Public" -- last chapter talks about Reddit and Twitter more than open source
    * somehow, The Hacker Ethos (sharing) and The Grift (max public) have gotten confused
        * "radparency" kinda sucks
        * sharing is fun ("We Have No Moat")
    * btw, I am not, uh, recommending you read this book. Maybe don't read this book.
* of course, I'm also out to sell something
    * Endb: Rust + Common Lisp
    * Endb SQL
* Can we _Embrace And Extend_ "The Grift"?

## Putting Them Together

* flip this on its head: don't (just) come to conferences like this to find a job -- or to hire
  ... depending on the season.
* ThoughtWorks: Ruby @ Work
* DRW: Clojure @ Work
* Nilenso: Clojure IS Work
* XTDB: Clojure is outmoded ... oh no, my QBASIC
* Endb: Rust and SBCL are not my new religion, but they're fun
* we are very fortunate to solve puzzles all day, experimenting, learning, playing
